# PyTorch-practice

## What is PyTorch?
- Most popular research deep learning framework
- Write fast deep learning code in Python to run on GPU(s)
- Access to pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub or torchvision.models)
- Full workflow supported: Preprocess data, model data, deploy model in application or on cloud

## Tensors
- Multi-dimensional arrays of numbers used to represent and store data
- Numerically-encoded data which is passed to or obtained from neural networks
